## Introduction

Minishell is a lightweight shell designed to demonstrate basic shell operations, with a special emphasis on efficiently searching for and launching executables. It provides a command-line interface that allows users to execute programs either by specifying their absolute or relative path or relying on the system's PATH variable.

## Features

- Efficient executable search based on the PATH variable
- Support for launching executables with relative or absolute paths
- Basic shell functionalities (e.g., command execution, input/output redirection, pipelines)
- Simple built-in commands (e.g., `cd`, `echo`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`)
- Input/output/appended/heredoc redirection
- Pipeline support
- Basic error handling
- Signal handling for ctrl-C, ctrl-D, and ctrl-\

### Command Execution

Describe the command execution feature here. Include any details about how Minishell executes commands and any specific behaviors.

### Built-in Commands

Minishell supports various built-in commands. Some examples include:

- `cd`: Change directory
- `echo`: Print arguments to the standard output
- `pwd`: Print the current working directory
- `export`: Set environment variables
- `unset`: Unset environment variables

### Redirection

Minishell supports input/output/appended/heredoc redirection. Here are examples:

- Input redirection: `command < input.txt`
- Output redirection: `command > output.txt`
- Appended redirection: `command >> output.txt`
- Heredoc redirection: `command << EOF`

### Pipeline Support
